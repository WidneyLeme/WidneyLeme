👋 Hi! I'm Widney Leme, a Brazilian 🇧🇷 living in Ireland 🇮🇪 since 2022.  
🎓 Final semester student in Systems Analysis and Development  

🧠 Learning tech by day, improving my English daily, and working as a chef 👨‍🍳 by night.  
💻 Passionate about front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  

🛠️ First project: [WidneyLinks](https://widneyleme.github.io/WidneyLinks/) – a responsive link aggregator  
💡 I believe in creating opportunities through action, not waiting for the “perfect moment”  

💪 Resilience is my strongest skill — in code, in life, and in every challenge  
🚀 Open to internships, volunteer work or first tech jobs — ready to learn and grow!

Let’s connect! 🤝
